# Node.js & Drupal

## DrupalCampMA 2013

Node.js is an easy way to build fast and scalable network applications. Paired with Drupal, your site can provide realtime data/notifications without crippling your server. There exists a nodejs module that integrates them both and exposes a set of API functions for you to extend in your own module.

This session I'll cover:

- Small intro of Node.js and when you want to use it
- Node.js vs Apache + PHP
- How the Nodejs module works
- Walkthrough of how to build a simple module that extends these capabilities

Building custom modules should be in your tool belt as we'll dive right into code fairly quickly.
